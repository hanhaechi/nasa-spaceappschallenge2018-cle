Created by "Fire The Spot" team during NASA's Space Apps Challenge 2018 hackathon at NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio, US

Our team chose to tackle "Spot The Fire" challenge as defined on https://2018.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/volcanoes-icebergs-and-asteroids-oh-my/real-time-fire-app/details

Instead of creating a tool allowing people to report fires we thought of how to harness existing data in a meaningful and engaging way, and ended up aggregating various maps (layers) and allowing our intelligent user find the location of interest (= "Fire The Spot"), analyse maps (Active Fires map, Wildfire Risk map, etc), and decide fire vulnerability for that specific spot. 

We've also aggregated information on how to act depending on perceived fire vulnerability level.
